# Hi, I'm Pedro Chatelain ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a backend developer passionate about building reliable and scalable applications. I recently graduated as a **TÃ©cnico Universitario en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones InformÃ¡ticas** at **UNICEN**, and Iâ€™ve been growing my experience through both professional and personal projects.  

In this space Iâ€™ll be sharing some of the projects Iâ€™ve been working on, both for learning and as portfolio pieces

### UserBuy  

#### What is UserBuy?  
UserBuy is a small e-commerce application Iâ€™m building to showcase my skills. It allows users to register as **customers** or **admins**, manage products, and simulate purchases with a virtual wallet system.
